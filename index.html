          I completed my first triathlon in 2019 and immediately became hooked.
          I hopped on my computer post-race and started looking for my next one.
          I decided that my next goal would be to finish an Ironman, a triathlon
          with a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, a 26.2 mile run. Fast forward a
          few years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and I finally completed one:
          Ironman California in Sacramento, California.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two of the most important things I did to prepare for the race were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, I purchased a triathlon bike. I completed my first triathlon
            with a regular road bike and while that was sufficient for a shorter
            distance race, having a proper triathlon bike can make a huge
            difference in how much energy you can save due to the efficiency
            gains.
          </li>

          <li>
            Next, I hired a triathlon coach. I had no idea where to start with
            training and preparing for a race of this distance, thankfully I
            found a coach that lives in the same city as me. Very convenient!
            His expertise and guidance has helped me improve across all three
            disciplines and was a major reason why I was able to finish the
            race.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          After training for almost a year, I flew to California a week before
          the race to acclimate to weather and time zone. I spent the week
          familiarizing myself with the course and getting in my final few
          workouts. The week flew by and before I knew it was time for race day.
          My partner and best friend flew out to watch me and their support
          helped to keep me from bailing at the last minute due to nerves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Race day came and started with the final checks of all my gear and
          nutrition for the day. I made my way to the swim start, anxiously
          awaiting the long day ahead. The gun went off and after few minutes I
          was able to start the race. It was a long and challenging day but
          after 13 hours and 40 minutes I crossed the finish line. To this
          day it is one of my biggest accomplishments.
